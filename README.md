# 🐇🐈🐕 PetCafe Prereleases

This repository contains public prerelase versions of PetCafe.
Versions found on [here](https://github.com/Sudden-Drop/PetCafe-Prerelease/releases) are free and can be played without restrictions.

- `x.y.z-alpha…`: very early versions that still contain a lot of bugs, features are missing, and assets are largely placeholders.
- `x.y.z-beta…`: more stable versions.

# ℹ️ About
In PetCafe, you run your very own restaurants and cafés, with a delightful twist: everyone is an animal! From your character to your employees and customers, all are adorable animal characters. Prepare delicious dishes, serve them to your patrons, expand your estate to open new locations, upgrade your appliances, discover exciting new recipes, keep your shops spotless, and build a thriving culinary empire.

# 💡 Alpha Explanations
As a lot of features are unfinished and UX leaves a lot to be desired, a few explanations for playing early versions:

### Managing Furnishing
You can only decorate your restaurants when you closed them manually on the overworld. Opening the context menu again after closing will show a button `Manage`. You then have to reopen the restaurant for customers to come in again

### Employees
Once you have hired an employee from the market, they are available when managing a restaurant. Clicking on them will grey out their portrait, implying that they will help there. Employees will prepare and bring dishes to tables.

### Repairing
Using machines will cause wear and tear on them. This is implied by a speech bubble with a wrench and screwdriver.
Machines that are at low health will take longer to produce dishes. You can repair them by switching to your repair action (<kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>E</kbd>) and hitting it with your wrench (<kbd>left alt</kbd>).

### Cleaning
Customers and employees moving through your restaurants will cause dirt on the floor.
Dirt is currently only a visual mechanic. You can clean it by switching to your broom action (<kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>E</kbd>) and holding <kbd>left alt</kbd> while moving over dirt. You can also buy a vacuum robot to clean it for you.
Customers and employees will drag in more dirt during bad weather.

### Reputation
Fulfilling customer orders will leave the customer satisfied and increase your reputation. If you let your customers wait too long, their patience runs out and your reputation will decrease. This currently has no bearing.

# 🎮 Controls
You will be able to remap controls in the future, but for now, they are hard coded:

- <kbd>W</kbd> – move up
- <kbd>A</kbd> – move left
- <kbd>S</kbd> – move down
- <kbd>D</kbd> – move right
- <kbd>space</kbd> – primary action
- <kbd>left alt</kbd> – secondary action
- <kbd>Q</kbd> – previous secondary action
- <kbd>E</kbd> – next secondary action
- <kbd>T</kbd> – open skill tree (only when in restaurant)
- <kbd>enter</kbd> – open cheat menu (only when in overworld)

# ❓ FAQ
## I Found a Problem With One of The Prerelease Versions
Please open [a bug report](https://github.com/Sudden-Drop/PetCafe-Prerelease/issues/new/choose) and let me know! Make sure to include which version of PetCafe you were using (you can see a build version in the bottm left side of the title screen) and on what OS you were playing.
Or you can drop a message [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TNKhRJB87V).

## When will PetCafe be fully released?
When it is done(™️). I am developing solo while working full time, and I only want to put up a full release when I feel like players receive an enjoyable experience.

## Is There a Steam Page Already?
Not yet. Steam charges a one-time payment of $100 per game you create there, so I don't want to prematurely sink costs on that end. I will put one up once the game reaches beta status.
For now, all updates will be posted on this page and can be discussed on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/TNKhRJB87V).

## Is There a Roadmap?
Not exactly. I still have a lot of ideas I want to explore and I will eventually write up a bunch of features that will definitely come, or that will come if players voice enough interest.

## What Will PetCafe Cost?
I will aim for a full release price at below $20. That is: $20 will be my base price and I'll see how far I can push it below that. I want the game to be affordable and still cover development expenses, such as fairly paying artists providing assets. There will be no loot boxes, microtransactions, or similar mechanics.
