# ❓ FAQ
## I Found a Problem With One of The Prerelease Versions
Please open [a bug report](https://github.com/Sudden-Drop/PetCafe-Prerelease/issues/new/choose) and let me know! Make sure to include which version of PetCafe you were using (you can see a build version in the bottm left side of the title screen) and on what OS you were playing. 

## When will PetCafe be fully released?
When it is done(™️). I am developing solo while working full time, and I only want to put up a full release when I feel like players receive an enjoyable experience.

## Is There a Steam Page Already?
Not yet. Steam charges a one-time payment of $100 per game you create there, so I don't want to prematurely sink costs on that end. I will put one up once the game reaches beta status.
For now, all updates will be posted on this page and I will set up a Discord server soonish.

## Is There a Roadmap?
Not exactly. I still have a lot of ideas I want to explore and I will eventually write up a bunch of features that will definitely come, or that will come if players voice enough interest.

## What Will PetCafe Cost?
I will aim for a full release price at below $20. That is: $20 will be my base price and I'll see how far I can push it below that. I want the game to be affordable and still cover development expenses, such as paying artists providing assets fairly. There will be no loot boxes, microtransactions, or similar mechanics.
